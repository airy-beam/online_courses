This is a repo with my homeworks and other stuff for online courses that I have passed or am taking now.
==============

*To protect original copyright, filetypes .pdf, .ppt, .pptx were added to gitignore and will not show here.*
All homeworks and tasks are open and shared with everybody, but surely they are shared as a reference only, and should not be used for cheating.
