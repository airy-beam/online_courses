NOTE:The molecular clock hypothesis is not included in this PAUP block for reasons of
computing time. This hypothesis may be tested once we have chosen one of the above
models, simply calculating the log likelihood score of the chosen model with the
molecular clock enforced and comparing it with the log likelihood previously obtained
without enforcing the molecular clock. In this case, the molecular clock is the
null hypothesis. The number of degrees of freedom is the number of OTUs - 2
